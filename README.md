# Drop Me Off - an Android carpooling app
This is a [WIP] carpooling app made for Android versions 6 and above. The app offers features such as: 
- Creating, viewing and editing user profiles 
- Offering rides (with a handy Google Maps UI)
- Searching for rides based on various parameters
- Reviewing user experiences

Furthermore the app enables matching rides that start and/or end in the middle of another, longer ride - making it ideal to use even for people living in less populated areas.
